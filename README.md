> Create Plus RedskySMP Modpack and Server Pack Files

This is a larger modpack, but should still feel fairly lightweight, thanks to various optimization mods, such as Rubidium (an unofficial Forge port of Sodium) and Starlight (for the lighting engine).
The pack primarily focuses on The Create Mod and a variety of Create-based addons while implementing some Quality of Life and Vanillla Enhancements through projects such as Mouse Tweaks or Yung's Better Dungeons.
The modpack also allows for a lot of customization using mods like Tetra, Sophisticated Backpacks, Supplementaries, and of course the Create mod itself.
Regardless of your playstyle, there is a bit of something for each of you. For those afraid of using Create, there are plenty of tutorials both in-game and across the web to help you get a better understanding of what you're working with.

> As of version 1.1 magic has been added to the pack through Ars Nouveau, Hex Casting, and Hexerei as well as several Ars Nouveau addons and compats (such as Ars Creo for Create compat).

For those wishing to run this on a server, I have also included FTB Essentials and Open Parties and Claims, to assist with chunk claiming and basic server management.

This modpack started out as a modified version of the Create+ modpack by stormdragon_64.
However, it has (at this point) been HEAVILY modified to no longer be anywhere near the original with a large number of additions, too many to list in fact.
This pack is designed mainly for the use of our private server, but all are free to use it as they please!

The original pack was designed to be Optifine compatible. However, I am not as big a fan of that mod at this point.
For more info on why that is, check out this page (mainly has to do with it being closed-source). As such, I have added in projects like Rubidium, Oculus, and Ok Zoomer to get many of the same functionalities as Optifine.
The original author has also mentioned purposefully avoiding client side mods, leaving it up to the players to add as they see fit. However, I wanted to make things easier for the player by including some of the more common ones out of the gate.

It is recommended to allocate at least 4-6GB of RAM to this pack on the client side.
